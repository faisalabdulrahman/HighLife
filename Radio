Would it be possible if there was some sort of update where the staff could make everyone hear the same song at the same time? For instance when I am on Flylow Fm and the song 4am is playing, my friends in the car with me cant hear the same song, they are on the same radio but they hear a completely different song. Idk it may be silly but I think it enhances the RP experience a little bit when we all listening to the same thing on the radio at the same time. Let me know your thoughts everyone thanks!
